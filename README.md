# TensorFlow Assignment

## Overview
This assignment covers fundamental TensorFlow concepts, including tensor manipulations, loss functions, model training with different optimizers, and TensorBoard logging. The tasks provide hands-on experience with deep learning techniques and model performance evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

To install the required dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib
```

## Task Descriptions

### Task 1: Tensor Manipulations & Reshaping
- Create and manipulate tensors.
- Reshape and transpose tensors.
- Perform broadcasting operations.

### Task 2: Loss Functions & Hyperparameter Tuning
- Compute Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Categorical Cross-Entropy (CCE) losses.
- Analyze how small changes in predictions affect loss values.
- Visualize loss comparisons using Matplotlib.

### Task 3: Train a Model with Different Optimizers
- Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset.
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Adam and SGD optimizers.
- Compare training and validation accuracy trends using plots.

### Task 4: Train a Neural Network and Log to TensorBoard
- Train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset.
- Log training progress using TensorBoard.
- Launch TensorBoard for visualization.

## Running the Assignment
1. Clone or download the assignment files.
2. Run each Python script in sequence to execute the tasks.
3. For TensorBoard visualization, run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
tensorboard --logdir=logs/fit
```
4. Open the displayed URL in a web browser to monitor training metrics.

## Expected Outputs
- Printed tensor manipulations and loss values.
- Graphs comparing loss functions and optimizer performance.
- TensorBoard logs for model training visualization.

## Notes
- Ensure TensorFlow is installed before running the scripts.
- Modify hyperparameters or model architectures for further experimentation.
